# semanticSimilarity

This notebook demonstrates calculating 2 sentences similarity scores by using **distilbert** Sentence transformer to get sentence level embeddings and then using 'cosine similarity' to get similarity score.

It can quantify the degree of similarity between the two text-based on Semantic similarity. It assesses the degree to which two sentences are semantically equivalent to each other. 
**1 means highly similar 0 means highly dissimilar**
